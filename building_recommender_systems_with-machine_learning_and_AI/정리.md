## 1. Basic of Recommender System
#### Implicit ratings : purchase data, video viewing data, click data
- a byproduct of users's natural behavior
- easy to get lots of it

#### Explicit ratings : star reviews
- provide very good data
- require extra work from users

## 2. Introduction to Python(optional)
## 3. Evaluating Recommender Systems
- RMSE, MAE

## [metric for top-n recommenders that accounts for the rank of predicted items]
  
### 1. hit rate
- generate top end recommendations for all of the users
- users actually rate -> consider that a hit
- add up all the hits / number of users
- tricky
### 2. Leave-one-out cv
- remove one of those items from that users training data
### 3. ARHR(Average Reciproca Hit Rate)
- more user focused metric (users tend to focus on the beginning of lists)

### coverage = (1-S)
- percentage of possible recommendations that your system is able to provide.
### diversity
- how broad a variety of items your recommender system is puttin in front of people
- low diversity : 오직 같은 시리즈의 채만 추천함
- (1-S) : S = avg similarity between recommendatio pairs
- achieve very high diversity by just recommending completely random items
### novely = mean popularity rank of recommended items
- how popular the items are that you're recommending
- just recommending random stuff -> high novelty scores(대다수의 물건들은 top seller가 아니기 때문)
- strike a balnce between familar, popular items and what we call serendipitous discovery of new items.
- RS can help people discover items in the long tail 

### churn : 휘젓다
- 추천 목록을 더이상 구매하지 않는데 계속 같은 품목을 추천하면 안 됨.
- a little bit of randomization -> look fresh
- high churn is not in itself a good thing
- maximize churn metric(completely random) -> not good recommendation
### responsiveness : how quickly does new user behavior influence your recommendations?
- more responsiveness would always seem to be a good thing
- 유지 비용, complex 등의 어려움
- strike a balance between responsiveness and simplicity

- 위와 같은 offline setting들은 실제 적용했을 때, 틀릴 수 있다.
- 반드시 online 을 통해 직접 test해봐야 함

-'surrogate problem' : There is a real effect where often accuracy merics tell you that an algorithm is great, only to have it do horribly in an online test
